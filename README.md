**Example:**
1. https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_gradients.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_rectangles.asp
2. https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_circles.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/canvas_rotate.asp
3. https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_shadows.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_rectangles.asp
4. https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_circles.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_rectangles.asp

**Explanation:**
- The program is a website with four canvases and four buttons. Hitting each of the buttons generates a series of polygons on the canvas.
- The website takes mashed together code lines from the w3schools example site (like for rectangles, gradients, etc.) with values and locations
changed.
