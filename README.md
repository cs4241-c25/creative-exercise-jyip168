Inclass Exercise - Creative Coding: Interactive Multimedia
===
For this in-class exercise, you will focus on client-side development using popular audio/graphics/visualization technologies. The goal of this assignment is to get aquainted with and explore some multimedia capabilities of the browser.

Requirements
---
Explore one of the four sites below or another Javascript/Typescript multimedia site of your choice. Take one of their examples, make a slight modification and get it to work using a simple back-end server (node.js, Express, NextJS) that serves just that example page(s). You may work with your teammates but each person has to create their own pages and their own unique code. The following lists some possibilities.

### Canvas
- Go through the [W3 Schools Canvas Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp). Implement a web page that draws text and several different polygons in different colors using Canvas - the <canvas> tag. One of the drawn items should include a color gradient.

Deliverables

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements.
2. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch/Heroku/etc., it displays correctly.
3. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `creative-exercise-githubname` so we can find it.
4. Push your final solution to your GitHub repository and modify the README to the specifications below.
